# Command Development

To ensure a consistent command line experience for our users, development of new CLI commands must adhere to strict rules. Please familiarize yourself with the rules before developing on this CLI. This will result in a superb user experience. Thank you!!!

## Before developing please familiarize yourself with CLI development

CLI development has a big UX component to it. Please familiarize yourself with CLI development by reading the following two resources:
 1. [Command Line Interface Guidelines](https://clig.dev)
 2. [12 Factor CLI Apps](https://medium.com/@jdxcode/12-factor-cli-apps-dd3c227a0e46)

## Rule: always print to the screen via the `Printer`

To ensure consistent output we limit ourselves to printing to stdout and stderr via the `Printer`. If you need a type of output that the `Printer` does not yet support, then please build it into the `Printer` instead of working around it.

## Rule: each command must have both a human readable as well as a machine ouput

The `--json` flag is a persistent flag that allows our users to use the CLI for machine purposes. Please ensure that each commands supports both types of output.

## Rule: noun, verb, flags

Every CLI command must follow this structure:

 1. Noun - a noun is given on which the command operates, e.g. `missile`, for clarity a noun can be hyphenated, e.g. `nuclear-missile`
 2. Verb - this is always followed by a verb, e.g. `lauch`
 3. Flags - parameters given to this required combination of noun and verb are controlled with flags, e.g. `--destination graceful`


## Rule: always use the Printer to print and the logger for verbosity

Please only use the `Printer` to print to stdout and stderr. This is to ensure consistency. If there is anything that you are missing, you will have to update the Printer.

If you want to print intermediate results of what the CLI is doing for troubleshooting purposes please use the logger. The logger is also used by the OpenAPI generated code and when `verbose` mode is enabled any requests made are printed by that code.

## Rule: return CLIError from CLI commands when there is an error

Instead of printing errors directly using the Printer, please return errors from the CLI command's execution. This is to ensure error printing and handling is done consistently.

When you have an error related to the input of the CLI you should use a `CLIError` that set `ShowUsage` to true. When the error is related to the API or due to technical issues `ShowUsage` should be false.

## Rule: each command must contain clear help text

`Use:` - a skeleton example of command usage:
* **noun** level command: Show only the command name, `[command]` will be appended in the CLI help. For example:
  ```text
  # The `Use:` text for the `script` command:
    Use:   "script"

  # will result in the following being printed in the CLI help:
    Usage:
      sts script [command]
  ```

* **noun verb** level command: Any mutually exclusive or required flags should be included in this description, other flags will be covered under the general group `[flags]`, which is automatically added to the end of the `Usage:` text when printed in the CLI help. For example:
    ```text
    # the `Use:` text for the `script run` command
        Use:   "run {-s SCRIPT | -f FILE}"

    # will result in the following being printed in the CLI help
      Usage:
        sts script run {-s SCRIPT | -f FILE} [flags]
    ```
  * REQUIRED flags are always shown as standard text without any brackets. Optional flags are not. For example:
    ```text
    sts cli save-config --api-url API-URL --api-token API-TOKEN [flags]
    ```
  * REQUIRED, mutually exclusive flags are grouped inside curly brackets `{}` and separated by a pipe `|` - one of the options shown must be used. For example:
    ```text
    sts script run {-s SCRIPT | -f FILE} [flags]
    ```
  * OPTIONAL, mutually exclusive flags are grouped inside square brackets `[]` and separated by a pipe `|` - only one of the options shown can be used
  * all other OPTIONAL flags are not included, these are covered by the general group `[flags]` that will be added automatically

`Short:` - a concise description of the command:
* Start with a lower case letter
* Maximum one sentence in length
* No full stop (`.`) at the end
* Start with a verb and then describe what that verb works on. This should provide more info than the command.

`Long:` - a description of the command:
* Start with upper case
* Full stop (`.`) at the end
* Can be multiple sentences.
* Do not use too many abbreviations.

`Example:` - copy/paste examples of command usage:
* Each example should start with a commented description of what it does.
  * Start with a lower case letter
  * Maximum one sentence in length
  * No full stop (`.`) at the end
  * Start with a verb and then describe what the command does
* Examples should be given that cover as many of the available options as possible.
* Try to stick to no more than 3 examples.
* For example:
  ```text
  # the Example: text for the `script run` command
    Example: "# run a script from file\n"+
      "sts script run --file \"path/to/my.script\"\n"+
      "\n"+
      "# run a script with variables provided by an arguments-script\n"+
      "sts script run --script \"x+y\" --arguments-script \"[x: 1, y: 2]\"",

  # will result in the following being printed in the CLI help
    Examples:
    # run a script from file
    sts script run --file "path/to/my.script"

    # run a script with variables provided by an arguments-script
    sts script run --script "x+y" --arguments-script "[x: 1, y: 2]"
  ```

## Rule: command nouns must be plural if it pertains to a set of entities

If there are multiple of a type of entity in StackState, please use plural.

## Rule: reuse command verbs as much as possible 

 * apply - applies some entity to StackState.
 * list - lists a set of entities in table form.
 * describe - describes a single entity. Outputs directly to screen.
 * export - descrbies a set of entities. Outputs to file.

## Rule: Flags short-hands must share meaning amongst all commands

Short hands for flags (single letter flags) should have the same meaning amongst all commands.

For example: `-f` is a short hand for the `--file` flag. That is true for `script run` as well as for `monitor create`. If `-f` is usable in any other command is must be the short hand fo `--file`.

If you want to introduce a shorthand for a flag, please do some research into other CLI's flag's shorthands and what they typically mean there.
